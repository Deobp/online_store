## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-name]
```

2. Backend setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Create .env file with:
DB_CONNECT = mongodb://<username>:<password>@host:port/dbname
PORT = 3000
SALT_ROUNDS = 1
JWT_SECRET = "your_secret_key"

# Start server
node server.js
```

3. Frontend setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Security Features

### Authentication Implementation
- JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Secure session management
- Protection against XSS attacks
- CSRF protection through cookies
- Automatic token cleanup on logout

### Cookie Settings
```javascript
res.cookie("token", token, {
  httpOnly: true,    // Prevents JavaScript access
  maxAge: 3600000,   // 1 hour expiration
  // secure: true,   // Uncomment in production (HTTPS only)
  // sameSite: 'strict'  // CSRF protection
});
```

## API Documentation

### Authentication Endpoints

#### Register User
```http
POST /api/users/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "country": "USA",
  "city": "New York",
  "street": "Broadway",
  "house": 123,
  "apartment": 45
}

// Response: Sets HTTP-only cookie with JWT token
```

#### Login
```http
POST /api/users/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "password": "SecurePass123!"
}

// Response: Sets HTTP-only cookie with JWT token
```

#### Logout
```http
POST /api/users/logout

// Response: Clears the token cookie
```

### Product Management

#### Create Product (Admin)
```http
POST /api/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product Description",
  "price": 99.99,
  "quantity": 100,
  "categoryId": "category_id",
  "imagePath": "/images/product.jpg"
}
```

#### Get Products
```http
GET /api/products        # All products
GET /api/products/actual # In-stock products
GET /api/products/:id    # Specific product
```

### Category Management

#### Create Category (Admin)
```http
POST /api/categories
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Category Name",
  "description": "Category Description"
}
```

#### Get Categories
```http
GET /api/categories
GET /api/categories/:id
GET /api/categories/:id/products
```

### Order Management

#### Create Order
```http
POST /api/users/:id/orders
```

#### Update Order Status (Admin)
```http
PATCH /api/orders/:id
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "shipping"
}
```

### Shopping Cart

#### Add to Cart
```http
POST /api/users/:id/cart
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId": "product_id",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

#### View Cart
```http
GET /api/users/:id/cart
```

#### Clear Cart
```http
POST /api/users/:id/cart/clear
```

## Data Validation

The application implements thorough data validation:

### User Data
- Username: Lowercase letters and numbers only
- Password: Minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Email: Valid email format
- Phone: International format with + prefix
- Names: Letters and spaces only

### Product Data
- Name: 3-100 characters, alphanumeric with some special characters
- Description: 10-1000 characters
- Price: Positive number
- Quantity: Positive integer

### Order Processing
- Stock verification before order placement
- Automatic stock adjustment
- Status transition validation

## Testing

The API endpoints have been tested using Postman.

### Postman Configuration
1. Enable cookie handling in Postman:
   - Go to Settings â†’ General
   - Enable "Automatically follow redirects"
   - Enable "Send cookies"

2. Testing authentication flow:
   - Send login request
   - Cookies will be automatically handled
   - Subsequent requests will include the cookie

### Test Scenarios
1. Authentication Flow:
   - Register new user
   - Login and verify cookie is set
   - Access protected route
   - Logout and verify cookie is cleared

2. Authorization Tests:
   - Test admin routes with regular user cookie
   - Verify appropriate error responses
   - Test permission-based functionalities
